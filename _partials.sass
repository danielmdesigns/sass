//Partials

//Partials allow you to code your stuff in smaller chunks. For example, I can have a "button" partial file that only has the code that makes up a button. Or, you can store all of your colors in a partial file. Maybe you want all your fonts and typography stuff in a partial file. You code everything in smaller chunks then add them all into your main css file

//DEFINE Partial
//Name your .sass file with a _ infront of the name
// _partial-file.sass
// _button.sass
//_colors.sass
//_fonts.sass

//USE Partial
@import partial-file
@import button
@import colors
@import fonts
